    Bounded priority queue inherited from a priority queue implementation. The
    differences are:
    - when the queue is full and the new element can be has enough priority to
    be inserted, we remove the less priority element;
    - the priority is reverted, that is, we remove the element with the 
    greatest priority, instead of the one with the least priority. This is
    because, in our application, small number means high priority.
